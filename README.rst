Python bindings to the OpenStack Test API
===========================================

This is a client library for Clictest built on the OpenStack Test API. It provides a Python API (the ``clictestclient`` module) and a command-line tool (``clictest``). This library fully supports the v1 Tests API, while support for the v2 API is in progress.
